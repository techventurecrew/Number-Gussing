# Number-Gussing
A fun twist on the classic number guessing game, enhanced with Snake game mechanics using Python. This hybrid project challenges players to guess the correct number while navigating a snake through obstacles, combining logic with reflex-based gameplay. Great for learning control flow, random number generation, and basic game development in Python.
